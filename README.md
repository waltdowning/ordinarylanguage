# OrdinaryLanguage Interpreter

Command line interpreter/REPL that accepts simple instructions in the form of sentences written in grammatically correct English (within syntactic requirements), such as:

- Divide 9 by 3.
- Multiply that by 200.
- Store that as the variable MyNumber.
- Write MyNumber on the display.

## Future Plans

While the OrdinaryLanguage Interpreter is currently suitable as a learning toy for non-programmers to interact with a computer in a way that requires only ordinary English, it's not yet a complete programming language.

Future plans include:

- Adding support for boolean expressions.
- Creating an OrdinaryLanguage to Python transpilier in Python that accepts OrdinaryLanguage in paragraph form and returns a Python script.
- Creating an OrdinaryLanguage compiler in C.
